## System Architecture (High-Level)

ESP32 Devices -> Firebase Realtime Database -> Web Dashboard

Each ESP32 uses a dedicated Firebase node:
devices/esp32_1 (Energy Monitoring)
devices/esp32_2 (Environment Monitoring)

## Tech Stack

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
Cloud Backend: Firebase Realtime Database, Firebase Authentication  
Hardware: ESP32 (multiple devices)  
Charts: Chart.js
